            <p>In high school I took Spanish, and I actually got decent at it (although I was slow at speaking). By sophomore year of high school,  I was no longer good at it. Despite that fact, I was fully confident in my ability to be able to figure out French words since some of them had similar roots to Spanish ones. In my Spanish class, my teacher repeatedly told us about hostels and how she had stayed in them during her travels. I was intrigued then but had never been yet. I researched one and saw it was only about $15 USD a night, and at that point I was much more interested. Sleeping in a room with random people seemed somewhat intimidating, if only because I would have to convince other people to do it with me. Thankfully I was able to convince a few of my friends to join me in Montreal, and the dates were set. </p>
            <p>This trip, Montreal, and the people I met there changed my life forever. I met people who were on months or even years long travels, something I could not even comprehend. I was intrigued and was questioning how on Earth they were pulling this off. Were they remote workers? Trust fund babies? Drug dealers? As it turns out, none of those. They were just normal people like you and me. One thing I noticed was that most of them were either European or Australian. They graduated from college and instead of diving head first into a career they were taking some time to live life. This was a concept that I had never even considered a remote possibility before. Maybe it was because of my socioeconomic status, maybe it was because I live in a country where a college education is prohibitively expensive, or maybe I am just not that creative. All I knew was that taking time to travel was something that I was definitely going to do from now on.</p>
            <p>Not only did I interrogate these people, but I hung out with them and had the time of my life. I made some friendships that I still have today, and I found a whole new perspective on life. I honestly think that if everyone had the ability to travel, the world would be a much more kind and understanding place. We are indoctrinated from childhood that the people in other places are dangerous and want to hurt us, but I find this to be incredibly false. People are just people, they want the best for themselves and their families. No matter where you look in the world you will find bad people, but that does not mean we should automatically assume every place on the Earth we are not familiar with is an extremely dangerous warzone where we will get scammed and robbed, but I digress.</p>
            <p>Okay back to Montreal. I had been to Canada before, specifically Toronto. It was always enjoyable and the people were always incredibly nice. There is one major difference between the two. In Toronto, when you go to a cafe you hear people talking. In Montreal, when you go to a cafe you hear people talking <i>in french</i>! I was, as one of my friends put it, <i>lost in another culture</i>. Although I could say all of two sentences properly in the language, I enjoyed going through Duolingo and learning utterly useless phrases. “The apple eats the boy” - Thanks Duolingo.</p>
            <p>To recap, this was a trip that changed my outlook on life. I now knew that I <b>had</b> to travel around the world. I know that when I graduate my first focus is going to be paying back my student loans as soon as possible, which is the same as before. But now instead of saving money so I can buy Nissan GTR as soon as possible, I am going to be saving as much as possible so one day I can live off of the interest while I travel the world meeting new people and seeing everything I possibly can. Maybe there will be room somewhere in there for a GTR, we’ll see.</p>
