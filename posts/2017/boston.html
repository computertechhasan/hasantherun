                <p>I had been to Boston a few times, mostly in high school. Always thought it was okay, but New York is my home so obviously I had to have my fair share of contempt for it. Despite that contempt, when my college had a trip going for less than $100 I had no option but to jump on the opportunity because it was such a good deal for a weekend trip at a pretty decent hotel.</p>
                <p>The bus ride was <b>atrocious</b>. We had to drive through the state with the worst traffic in the world (Connecticut) during rush hour because for some reason it is okay to miss evening classes but not day classes. I will never understand the logic used by student activities councils and the like to make those decisions instead of leaving early to avoid traffic and maximize time at the destination. This is a rant for another time</p>
                <p>Boston has some good things going for it. It is pretty clean, the proximity to the ocean is great, and there is a fair bit of history for those that are into that sort of thing. There are a few things that Boston needs to work on, the first of which is public transport. The city is actually fairly well connected, but they need more trains. I remember on Saturday night at 7pm I was waiting for a train with about six hundred seventy four thousand other people. What arrived actually left my jaw on the floor. During this busy time, they sent a little rinky dink train with only two cars that looked like it was from the seventies. During the day when no one was taking the train they had long spacious subway cars, and during prime time they sent this. <i>Really?</i></p>
                <p>The other thing Boston needs to work on is to eliminate its Puritanical roots and let stuff stay open later than 10pm. What type of self respecting <i>city</i> becomes a complete and total utter ghosttown so early? Being a usual in the city that never sleeps, this was depressing (I was not 21 yet, so was really hoping on some late night coffee shops or something). Scouring the internet I found that two things would be open all night: South Street Diner and Au Bon Pain...In Tufts Hospital.</p>
                <p>I actually ended up going to both places because I hatched the idea of taking pictures of the sun rising since I was so far East. After that we ventured over to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which was surprisingly unlocked and did some touristing around before catching the extremely long bus home (thanks Connecticut). Thankfully I had not slept, so it was a quick ride.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most memorable part of this trip was the shopping, I acquired my famous concert pants. In high school I wore nothing except cargo shorts that was seven or eight sizes too large. For some reason that I still can’t comprehend, I switched sometime in college to wearing incredibly tight jeans. Not tight enough to where it is painful, but I started hating the extra fabric look. In Boston, I purchased the tightest pair of jeans I had ever tried on that were a deep maroon in color with some weird lines. Why did I buy these? Not certain. However <i>since</i> they are so tight they are <b>excellent</b> for wearing to concerts because pick pocketing me is an incredibly difficult affair while I am wearing them. So yes, the best part of this trip was a pair of jeans. I’ll go back now that I am 21 and give it another go.</p>
