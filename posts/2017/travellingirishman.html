                  <p>Yes, I went to Montreal again. If you read the About page you would know how much I love this place. This time we got to stay in the brand new section of the hostel which was even better than the other part. This time I knew some of the hotspots I definitely wanted to hit but the weather was much nicer and we were able to do some exploring we were not able to the first time.</p>
                  <p>Now I know how to ride a bike, I did it all the time as a kid. Despite this I had never rode a bike on the road with cars much, let alone in a city. My friend suggested we do it, and after the first five minutes I knew I had made a terrible mistake. My friend took off and I was took pursuit attempting not to be flattened by a pancake by the cars, vans, and trucks that surrounded us. I had a good time in the end, but I much prefer walking.</p>
                  <p>This was also the first time I explored the wonder that is Old Montreal. I have heard Montreal called a little slice of Europe in North America, and nothing shouts that more than Old Montreal. There was cobblestone streets, cute little cafes, and a beautiful waterfront just a few steps away.</p>
                  <p>There were two main things that gave this trip distinctive status in my mind. The first, was that I went clubbing for the first time. As a lover of all things EDM, I found my home in the club. If you ever find yourself walking the colorful Rue de Saint Catherine in Montreal, do yourself a favor and duck into Unity nightclub at night.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that made this trip distinctive was that we brought home a rather unique souvenir in the form of an Irishman. As I have written before hostels are one of the greatest things on this Earth, and at hostels you meet other travelers. We met one such traveler who was awesome, and he needed a way to go to Boston, so naturally we brought him home to New York City with us where he could catch a cheap ride to Boston. This had led to an incredible friendship and I bother him with travel questions since he is much better travelled than I am. For now.</p>
