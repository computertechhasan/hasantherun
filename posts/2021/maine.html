            <p> Have you ever wondered what life is all about? You could search the world and never figure it out.</p>
            <p>Seriously though. What is happiness? Is it success? Are they the same? Does one beget the other? Is it having a zillion dollars? Being on billboards and in magazines with millions looking up to you? Owning the latest and greatest gadget? Having the nicest clothes? Constantly taking trips to the world's most exotic locations? Being a force to be reckoned with on `the gram`? Finding true love? Being your own boss and answering to no one? The answer is none of these things. And all of these things.</p>
            <p>Stay with me, this incoherent rant is going somewhere. Go out on the street and stop 10 random people (wear a mask, its covid szn people), and ask them which of those things listed above would make them happy. I bet you get at minimum 11 different answers (and a few ‘can you just nots’). The thing is, it's different for everyone. One person might be elated by being on a billboard in Times Square, while it’s another person's actual nightmare. One person might feel like they have finally found their meaning when they start their dream job, while others don’t dream of labor. One person might be blown away that they have the privilege to go on a fishing boat once a week, while another thanks their lucky stars they are on land.</p>
            <p>The point is, there is no magic formula to happiness. It is not only different for every person, but it can even be different for you as you grow and change as a person. I challenge you to find, and to continually evaluate what it means to you. Ignoring what the rest of the world thinks and what they strive for, I want you to find what truly brings you happiness, and I want you to promise me you will never do yourself the disservice of ever thinking there is anything in the world more important than maximizing what does.</p>
            <p>For me? Happiness comes in the form of great times with far better people. It can be a board game night where we all leave with sore throats at 3AM after screaming at each other. It can be running through Ikea trying to regroup while leaving a trail of melted custard in our wake. Or sometimes it can be filling the car with my favorite people, putting on some Dev, and hitting the open road in search of the greatest lobster in Maine.</p>
