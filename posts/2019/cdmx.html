            <p>After receiving the devastating news that my school would not be holding its annual Colorado/Utah ski trip that I saved four years to go on, I needed something to do over winter break. I toyed around with many ideas until I finally settled on Mexico City, and started getting feelers. Pretty much no one was interested, and the plan fizzled out by the time finals came around in December. Right after finals I was sitting catching up with one of my good friends and mentioned my thoughts on going to CDMX over break. She responded with a “let’s do it”, and my interest was reignited. After convincing her parents to trust me with their daughter's safety in a foreign country that had strained relations with ours at the moment (a certain someone was particularly active on Twitter during this time), we booked our tickets for a few weeks later. </p>
            <p>After arriving and masterfully figuring out the best exchange rate, we set off on our uber to the hostel. I asked the driver “Donde estan los mejor tacos en la Ciudad de Mexico?”, which translated from my third grade Spanish vaguely means where can we get some bomb tacos. Our driver was delighted to not only tell us about tacos but also much more, which slowly changed to him saying “rico” over and over and over again for the entire ride when describing the various types of food we definitely needed to try while we were there.</p>
            <p>I have my Spanish high school teacher to greatly thank for being able to vaguely understand what was going on while I was in Mexico City. I was definitely a little rusty, but as the days went by I slowly gained back some flow in my speech. Despite my teacher’s best efforts, there are some things that are not teachable from a book that are just cultural. This lead to one of the funniest experiences of my life at a nice restaurant called El Mixteco just steps away from our hostel. We went there for a late lunch and got an incredible meal for an absolute steal, and a funny story to go with it. On the menu we saw a side dish titled “platanos tabascos”. Unsure what it was, we ordered two because it was very cheap and we could not wait to see what type of spicy plantain dish we were going to be served. Our meal came out but no sign of the side dish yet, we just chalked this up to the kitchen running slowly. As we were almost done eating a server came by with a plate of what we ordered. At first I told them we did not order what they brought us, and then I fell out of my chair laughing when they assured me we did. As it turns out “platanos tabascos” is NOT a spicy plantain dish, but rather how you say banana.</p>
            <p>We spent one of our days climbing pyramids of Teotihuacán, which lead to some breathtaking views of the surrounding scenery and a great history lesson. Accompanying that were some great cheeseless quesadillas we had for lunch at the site, and some good spirited haglinging with those selling keepsakes on the grounds. The best part about the pyramids were the videos we made, but you have to know me in person to see those.</p>
            <p>Translation issues withstanding, Mexico City was a great trip. The food was to die for, the people we met were delightful, and the sights were incredible. I unfortunately spent a bit too much time out at night and slept through the boat trip to Xochimilco run by the hostel, but I am actually not upset about that because I am definitely going back.</p>
