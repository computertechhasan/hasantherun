            <p>Not working at BestBuy anymore, I no longer had to work on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. This led to me being extremely confused about what to do. When I checked my school calendar and realized I effectively had two weeks off, I knew I had to find somewhere to go. After a few days of searching, I found some insanely cheap tickets to Chicago. Originally the plan was to spend the better part of two days on a bus, but when I found flights for the cost of a dinner more I jumped on them.</p>
            <p>To get to La Guardia my friend and I had to take a light rail, a train, another train, a subway, and a special bus that goes to the airport. This was to happen at 1230am to 4am. The day before we had a pretty serious snow storm, so we elected to leave an hour early just in case. Public transport was unaffected and we made it to the airport at 3am. As it turns out security doesn’t even open until 4, so we waited patiently until 3:30 when they started lining us up. We were one of the first ones in line at our gate, and were excited to be done with security. Just as the line was about to move we received a notification, our gate had changed. We sprinted down the airport and got a decent spot in line for security, although not first like before. While we were in line my friend told me to check my phone. I responded that I refused, I was not willing to accept another gate change. They were going to move that plane to the gate they promised I was not going to the back of the security line.</p>
            <p>As it turns out this notification was actually even more heartbreaking than that, our flight had been cancelled. As someone who never flies I ran to find an attendant, while my friend chased me and told me to call the airline because it would go faster. Originally they offered a flight at 8pm that day (it was currently 4am), that would arrive in Chicago at around 6am. I was very 
            confused because this was a 3 hour flight at maximum, and the attendant responded that this particular flight had a <i>quick</i> layover...in Phoenix. I told the attendant to try again, and magically a flight appeared at noon. I told the attendant to get us on that plane, and the attendant did. There was one slight issue with that flight - it was at JFK. So we made the trek over, sat in the airport for a few hours, then hopped on our plane and made it to Chicago (still faster than a bus).</p>
            <p>The hostel we were staying at was in an area called Bucktown, which to me seemed like the Williamsburg of Chicago. It was a good location only a few blocks from transit so that was very convenient, and I thought the hostel was good as well. I met someone there from Mexico City, and another from England. It was not as fancy as the one in Montreal, but the hostel vibe was definitely there.</p>
            <p>We started the next day with donuts at a local chain, and those were incredible. The filling was so rich I felt like I needed to walk a few miles after, but it was delicious. We then hit every touristy location possible, even going as far as to visit “The Bean” (Cloudgate) multiple times. We got some deep dish at one of the “famous” places, and we went to a bar at the 95th floor of one of the buildings there. The view was pretty nice, but I was more intrigued by that fact that there was a BestBuy in the bottom of this building.</p>
            <p>Being from New York, I went to Chicago pretty biased. I had grown up calling Chicago second rate New York, denouncing deep dish, and laughing at how bad their public transit must be because of how spaced out everything is. I ate my words while I was there. The public transit compensates for the size of Chicago by moving insanely quickly, about twice as fast as any subway I had taken in New York. Deep dish is actually really good, as much as it hurts me to say that. New York still is number one in my heart, but I ended this trip with an admiration for Chicago I never thought I would ever have.</p>
