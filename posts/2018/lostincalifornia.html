                <p>So I am terrified of flying. Absolutely terrified. I had been on a plane a few times before in my life, but that was well before I was old enough to drive and well before I understood the physics of flight and the world around us. Despite air travel being technically a few percentage points more dangerous then (citation needed), I am much more scared of it now. When I got the phone call to fly out to a California for work,I took the opportunity immediately.</p>
                <p>Flying actually went fine, and I think that people who complain about airlines are just whining for no reason. There are a few reasons why I might be wrong and they might have valid points. For one, if I make it to my destination in one piece I consider the airlines job complete because I did not die. Secondly, I am only 5 foot 7 (and three quarter inches, that is a quarter more than last year), so any amount of legroom is fine for me. I dressed nicely hoping to get a first class upgrade for free if there was space, however I did not remotely understand the level at which this system has been computerized. The entire upgrade process is digital to where my devilish charm unfortunately did not score me an upgrade. This was not the biggest deal in the world because I ended up knocking out for the entire flight.</p>
                <p>When I landed I trekked to the desk to get my rental car. I was originally given a Corolla, but given the fact that I was an hour from the Pacific Coast Highway, I begged for something better. An hour and a half, the potential for a Corvette, and $90 later I ended up with a newer Ford Mustang in an absolutely gorgeous color. I took it to a place called Philz Coffee at the suggestion of the manager of the rental car place, and was first annoyed that he sent me to a chain. After trying a Mocha Tesora, I realized that I was severely in the wrong. That was one of the best coffee drinks I have ever had, and I had one each day I was there.</p>
                <p>I ended up driving the car down to Half Moon Bay and driving up the Pacific Coast Highway almost all the way to San Francisco, stopping short to drive back to my hotel before rush hour traffic. This short journey up the PCH of only seventy miles took me almost three hours. This was surprisingly not because of the famed California traffic, but instead of the absolutely stunning vistas that I stopped every five minutes to admire.</p>
                <p> I only stopped at each spot for a few minutes because I was afraid I needed a parking pass or something similar and could get ticket, but eventually I found a guy who told me that was not the case. This was a stark difference to New Jersey where you pay for even thinking about the beach, and you pay for parking and to get on the beach. I have two hypothesis as to why. The first is that California is a fairly liberal place with high taxes, so no need to nickel and dime at the beach. On the other hand, I guessed since I was in what is considered “Northern California” the water was too cold for it to charge for. My biggest regret is not going back with a swimsuit to test out whether it was actually too cold, but that will have to wait until next time.</p>
                <p>I tried In-And-Out. Not that impressive.</p>
                <p>A new tradition I started on this trip was listening to a certain song a zillion times to remind me of the trip. This may or may not have happened accidently with me falling asleep on the plane with a song on repeat, but it worked out. The song for this trip was “California” by Dzeko ft Brynn Elliott. Yes it is pretty cheesy, but it is a pretty awesome driving song and good song on its own as well. Whenever I hear it now it reminds me of driving the PCH with the windows down and the sun dominating the sky.</p> 
                <p>Overall, California (Specifically the Bay Area) was an amazing place to visit for a few days. The scenery that I was constantly surrounded by was astounding, but I could not see myself living here. Everything here closed so early, which is a big difference to the city that never sleeps. I did not get the chance to have a proper night out in San Francisco, and I will go back to try it out. But the rest of the Bay Area was pretty dead at night. Also their public transit is lacking in my opinion. Maybe in 120 years or so they will have incredible public transit that is not buses (therefore less traffic problems) but until they do, I am perfectly content just visiting once in a while and taking in the nice weather.</p>
