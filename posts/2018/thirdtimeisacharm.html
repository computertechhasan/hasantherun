                <p>Okay even I am sensing that this is getting to be slightly excessive. But I came with a new friend who had never even been out of the United States before, let alone the wonderland that is Montreal, so it was worth it. Stayed at the same hostel in the new dorms once again, although a lot of the staff had changed by this point. Still there were a few familiar faces so that was nice.</p>
                <p>This trip was much familiar to the one from last time minus the bikes, plus a lot more sightseeing. This time we went to see the Parc du Mont-Royal which I was told by many I really should have gone to on my other two trips. It was a fairly nice view of the cities skyline but being from New York City I knew to keep my expectations lower than home. We also saw Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal, which I was not a fan of. Not because I don’t like churches, but instead because of the way people were behaving. Many people in this world are very religious, and I feel we should treat their places of worship with respect. I do not like it when people treat a church as just another tourist attraction where they are loud and run around taking pictures. A personal pet peeve, but I tried not to let it spoil the sights.</p>
                <p>This trip we unfortunately did not find any foreigners to smuggle back across the border to the United States, I suspect that is because this time we were four in total instead of three so it is more intimidating for those around us to try to join our group. We did for the first time go out for a nice meal, which is a tradition I think I will continue in my travels from now on. One memorable meal in a restaurant is a nice memory to have. And I’ll take any excuse to bust out the wingtips. But mostly the memory.</p>
