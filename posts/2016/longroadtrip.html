            <p>Working at BestBuy was probably one of the best jobs I ever had. Most people think I am utterly insane for thinking so. When people think retail, they think constantly complaining customers, low pay, and awful management. Sometimes they are right (I worked at K-Mart....Nuff Said). But BestBuy was different, at least for me. I had an incredible management team, the pay was better than K-Mart, and the sweet employee discount was incredible for someone who loves technology.</p>
            <p>Although BestBuy was awesome, it definitely had <i>some</i> downsides. Namely, there were certain times when I pulled incredibly long shifts. The obvious offenders would be holidays like Black Friday, but I one of these crazy long shifts in August 2016. I worked from 6pm until 4am, due to a BestBuy yearly event that I volunteered to work for the extra cash (I was leaving for vacation the next day). After getting to bed by 5AM, sleeping until 9AM, I woke up and hit the road.</p>
            <p>I was headed to meet my friend and his family in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for a weeklong vacation on the beach. After high school (I graduated in 2015) I had a friend who had moved to Charlotte, North Carolina so I planned to stop in Charlotte to visit him on the way down. This seemed like a fine and simple plan and I was excited to get going. Two days prior I had a scare with a flat tire, but that was resolved and nothing was going to interrupt my trip.</p>
            <p>I <b>refused</b> to go anywhere near Washington D.C. so this ruled out taking I-495. Instead I elected to take I-78 across Pennsylvania down to I-81, which I then took down pretty much all the way to Charlotte. I had my trusty V1 on the dash so I was making pretty decent time, except in the tyranny that is Virginia where I drove under the speed limit to ensure I did not end up in jail.</p>
            <p>I arrived in Charlotte around dinner time where I met my friend at his apartment. We got into his car (that I had yet to experience) and we did some <i>spirited</i> driving on the way to grab some food. He was one of my only friends at this point that worked to support himself entirely without help from his parents so we were able to empathize with each other over that and had a nice meal. After dinner we said our goodbyes and I got back into my car ready to make the short hour or so drive down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Or so I thought…</p>
            <p>If you look at the map of the United States, you can see that the Southern states seem to look a lot larger than the northern ones. As it turns out, this is because they are larger. I did not realize this. So when I asked Google: “How far am I from Myrtle Beach, SC” and she responded “3 hours and 45 minutes”, I was more than slightly shocked.</p>
            <p>This trip was nice because I got to spend some time on the beach and the weather was incredible. I also got to do one of the longest road trips I had up until this point, right around 2500 miles. That is including me returning home the next week and going to Erie, PA to see off my other friend who was moving into college for our second year. Overall, I miss road trips like this for the beautiful driving views and ability to change plans on a second's notice, but being able to park a car in a city is a major hassle so you are going to see my vacation preferences change over time. </p>
